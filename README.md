# Mobile Tracking

In the context of this project state-of-the-art real-time deep object detectors are adopted to mobile phones. It is aimed to improve the stand alone performance of these algorithms by using data acquired by mobile sensor. Current version is designed for [TinyYOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767) object detector enhanced by the acceleretor data but the algorithm can be easily generalized to other methods.

## Model Files

The model files that are used in this project are trained on COCO dataset. The model files from the original sources are as follows

- [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

- [TinyYOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights)

- [Mobilenetv1SSD]()

## Mobile Video Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from this [link.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOtgHJGJuaJt6EPJt9RX4-amDhORjVEm)


## Labeling the Frames

For labeling [DarkLabel](https://darkpgmr.tistory.com/16) is used. 


## Results

Description for the output videos can be given as:

- Green rectangle -> The BB generated by using MobileNetv1 SSD.

- Red rectangle -> The BB generated by using accelerometer data.

- Blue dashed rectangle -> The BB accepted as final decision.


All videos recorded at 24 FPS with 1280x720 resolution.

Result videos play at 3 FPS (8 times slower than original videos).

Target object is a car for videos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 12. For the other videos, the target object is a person.
