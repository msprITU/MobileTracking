### TinyYOLOv3 Object Detection

The main code for the Android application is given [here.](https://github.com/msprITU/MobileTracking/blob/master/sezai-source/MainActivity.java)

It takes videos as an input in and outputs videos + detection results as a text file for detected objects.

#### Requirements

- For the input videos; make the **"VideoSource"** directory inside DCIM directory of your phones internal storage.

- For the output videos; make the **"VideoResults"** directory again inside DCIM directory of you phones internal storage.

After these steps, just put the videos you want to perform object detection in "VideoSource". After the process, the app will save the 
results both as video and as a txt file.
